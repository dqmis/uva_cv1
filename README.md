# Computer Vision 1 Assignments

## Artificial Intelligence MsC @ University of Amsterdam

My solutions to the assignments of the course Computer Vision 1.

## Setup
You can either use Conda (yuck) and setup the environment with the provided `environment.yml` with python 3.6 (yuck) or use the provided `pyproject.toml` with poetry. As poetry deprecated support for python 3.6, poetry environments are setup with python 3.11. The code was written with backwards compatibility in mind but newer dependency versions could cause some issues so be cautious.
